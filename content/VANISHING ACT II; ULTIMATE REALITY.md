## Review
VANISHING ACT II: ULTIMATE REALITY is an intense electropop experience that offers a sensory overload. Personally, on first listen, I didn't feel much of a connection, likely because I wasn't in the right mood for something this energetic. However, after giving it a second go, I was able to appreciate the unique textures and complexities. It's an overwhelming listen, packed with so many elements happening simultaneously that it can feel overwhelming at times. 

Here are my best picks:
- To Be A Bat
- The Greatest Living Mucisian, Found Dead
