## Review
This album sounds vaguely similiar to [[The Bends]] of [[Radiohead]]. I've always underestimed this album. In the past, I'd say that this album was mid at best, that all the sound the same. But replaying it today and giving the album an honest attempt, I discovered many underrated tracks that honestly sound fine.
