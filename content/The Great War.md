## Notable tracks
- **The Future of Warfare** has a great solo near the end.
- **The Attack of the Dead Man** will always stand out to me. The story told is legendary, and the song is unique enough to differentiate it against the other tracks of the album.
- **A Ghost in the trenches** also stands out, but this is probably due to an unfamiliarity factor.
- **The end of the War to End All Wars** has a slow start, and I enjoy the choir at the end.
- **In Flanders Field** is a very different track than the other songs, and is also finally a track that feels more fitting for the tragic events of the Great War. I also like the choir in this one.
## Review
Sabaton always has great, catchy, accessible [[Power Metal]]. However, after a while, the music becomes repetitive and all the tracks blend together. For that reason I'd take my time before I replay another album of them.

The songs are related to the Great war, and I can't help but feel a bit cringed and uncomfortable about creating epic, symphonic songs on this tragic event, glorifying the war. This is not relevant for all tracks, some are (appropriatly) heavy and depressing.
## Genre
