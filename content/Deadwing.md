## Review
This album delivers a distinct, electric guitar sound that is instantly recognisable as the sound of Porcupine tree. The vocals complement the instrumentals well.
What stands out is the album's consistency. There are no weak tracks. Rather than picking out individual songs, I'm drawn to the album as a whole.
