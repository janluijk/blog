## Notable tracks
- Even Flow: Recognisable, enjoyable. Lyrics are about homelessness
- Alive, Once (and Footsteps): All great tracks, and there's also a short story that is told here. It tells a man's descent into madness which leads him into becoming a serial killer, because the man he thought was his father is actually his stepfather.
- Why Go: Lyrics are on the use of psuchiatric hospitals. 
- Black: I think the lyrics are on suicide. Really like this track
- Jeremy: According to Wikipedia, the lyrics tell a story based on real life events, of a boy that shot himself in front of his classmates. Although this is not explicitly mentioned in the song, the lyrics do seem to fit. 
- Right after Release, the hidden track Master/Slafe is played. It is all instrumental, and has a nice vibe to it. It also makes the album 'loop around', which is cool.
