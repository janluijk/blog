## Review
The album has limited variety that can make it feel somewhat bland overall. However, the use of electronic elements does add unique flavoor, setting the band apart. The tracks that do stand out do so because they are either catchy or unique compared to the rest of the album, rather than for any particularly strong songwriting.

Here are my personal picks of the strongest tracks of the album:
- ECHO
- TELEKINETIC 
- TRIALS
- WAKING UP
- OTHER WORLDS THAN THESE

## Genre
